# Learn Flow (Click â†’ Save)

This document visualizes the "Learn it" flow in the Select-Care extension. The diagram shows the UI components, service calls, background message, and storage steps from the moment the user clicks the Learn icon to when the selection is saved.

```

Notes:
- `populateLearnUI` calls an external dictionary adapter (`src/content_scripts/api/dictionary`) and dispatches `addMeaning` events.
- The popup keeps a "Custom Definition" button so the user can add definitions even if the dictionary yields no results.
- The save step uses `convertToSelection` (`src/content_scripts/data_mapper.ts`) and delivers the selection to the background via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.
- Background storage is handled in `src/service_worker/background.ts` and persists the selection to IndexedDB via `selectionDB`.

Accessibility & UX considerations:
- Loading skeleton uses a shimmer animation by default; the code respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for scrolling operations.
- When a meaning is expanded the popup will smooth-scroll the `.meanings-wrap` so the expanded element is fully visible (reduced motion respected).

Next steps (optional):
- Add an animated highlight when a new custom definition is created.
- Add a small toast on successful save.
- Add unit tests for the no-results and error flows.
